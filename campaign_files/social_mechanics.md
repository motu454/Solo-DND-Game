# Social Mechanics Framework

## Enhanced Social Interaction Protocol

### **Core Principle**
Every meaningful social interaction should involve skill checks to determine the quality and depth of information gathered or influence exerted. Never provide automatic psychological insight without appropriate rolls.

### **Standard Social Scene Structure**
1. **Environmental Setup** (concise, multi-sensory description)
2. **Initial NPC Reactions** (surface behavioral cues only)
3. **Skill Check Opportunities** (specific calls for rolls)
4. **Results-Based Information** (scaled to roll success)
5. **Clear Action Options** (with suggested skills)
