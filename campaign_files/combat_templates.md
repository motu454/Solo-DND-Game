# Combat Templates - Solo D&D Optimized

## Core Combat Principles

### Action Economy Compensation
- **Solo Challenge:** One player vs multiple enemies lacks tactical complexity
- **Solution:** Environmental interactions, not additional monsters
- **Resource Target:** 15-25% of daily resources per Medium encounter
- **Scaling Formula:** (Party CR รท 4) ร 1.25 + 10-20% environmental budget

## Template Categories

### Template 1: Defensive Siege
**Concept:** Elevated threat with environmental puzzle elements

**Structure:**
- **Primary Threat:** 1 elevated enemy (archer, spellcaster) in defensible position
- **Secondary Elements:** 2-3 interference runners disrupting positioning
- **Environmental Features:** Destructible cover, moveable barriers, interactive mechanisms

**Example - Starfall Manor Scenario:**
- **Lady Celestine:** Elevated position controlling binding circles
- **Guards:** 3-4 interference units preventing direct approach
- **Environment:** Binding circles (can be disrupted), chandeliers (destructible), multiple exits

**Tactical Options Each Turn:**
- Direct assault on primary threat
- Eliminate interference runners
- Environmental manipulation (destroy cover, activate mechanisms)
- Positioning for advantage (high ground, cover, flanking)

### Template 2: Pursuit Challenge
**Concept:** Mobile threats with dynamic terrain

**Structure:**
- **Primary Threats:** 2-3 high-mobility skirmishers
- **Tactics:** Hit-and-run, kiting, positioning denial
- **Environmental Features:** Changing elevations, appearing/disappearing obstacles, time pressure

**Example - Chase Through Westmarch:**
- **Enemies:** 2 mounted pursuers + 1 archer on rooftops
- **Environment:** Market stalls (destructible cover), narrow alleys (movement restriction), crowds (concealment/obstacles)
- **Time Pressure:** Reinforcements arriving, civilians in danger

**Tactical Options Each Turn:**
- Engage mobile threats directly
- Use environment to block pursuit routes
- Create obstacles or hazards
- Escape/evasion through terrain manipulation

### Template 3: Environmental Puzzle Combat
**Concept:** Boss encounter with mechanical puzzle elements

**Structure:**
- **Primary Threat:** 1 powerful opponent with defensive capabilities
- **Reinforcement Waves:** Continuous minor threats
- **Puzzle Solution:** Interactive elements that stop reinforcements when solved

**Example - Magical Laboratory:**
- **Boss:** Powerful mage with shield/regeneration
- **Reinforcements:** Animated constructs spawning continuously
- **Puzzle:** Magical focuses that must be activated in sequence to disrupt magic

**Tactical Options Each Turn:**
- Direct combat with boss
- Handle immediate reinforcement threats
- Work on puzzle elements (investigation/interaction)
- Combine approaches (fight while solving)

## Encounter Scaling Guidelines

### Level 3 Character (Current)
- **Easy:** CR 1/2 enemy + environmental elements
- **Medium:** CR 1 enemy + 2-3 minions + environmental complexity
- **Hard:** CR 2 enemy + environmental puzzle + time pressure
- **Deadly:** CR 3 enemy + multiple environmental threats + reinforcements

### Environmental Budget Guidelines
- **Simple:** 1-2 interactive elements (cover, elevation)
- **Moderate:** 2-3 interactive elements + 1 dynamic element (timed, moving)
- **Complex:** 3+ interactive elements + multiple dynamic elements + puzzle component

## Quick Combat Setup

### Environmental Element Types
1. **Destructible:** Cover that can be eliminated, barriers that can be broken
2. **Interactive:** Switches, levers, pressure plates requiring actions to activate
3. **Dynamic:** Moving platforms, rotating mechanisms, timed hazards
4. **Tactical:** High ground, chokepoints, concealment areas

### Immediate Tactical Options Template
For every combat, provide these options:
1. **Direct Combat:** Standard attack actions
2. **Environmental Interaction:** Specific environmental actions available
3. **Positioning:** Movement options that provide tactical advantage
4. **Creative Solutions:** Non-standard approaches using available elements

## Common Environmental Elements

### Urban Combat (Westmarch)
- **Market Stalls:** Destructible cover, improvised weapons
- **Rooftops:** Elevation advantage, jumping/climbing challenges
- **Crowds:** Concealment, movement obstacles, civilian protection
- **Architecture:** Balconies, stairs, narrow alleys creating tactical complexity

### Manor Combat (Starfall Manor)
- **Furniture:** Destructible cover, improvised barriers
- **Chandeliers:** Hazards when dropped, high ground when climbed
- **Multiple Levels:** Stairs, balconies creating elevation differences
- **Magical Elements:** Binding circles, ward stones, magical focuses

### Wilderness Combat
- **Terrain:** Elevation changes, difficult ground, natural cover
- **Vegetation:** Concealment, movement hindrance, fire hazards
- **Water Features:** Movement restriction, visibility reduction, tactical positioning
- **Weather:** Environmental conditions affecting visibility, movement, tactics

## Combat Resolution Framework

### Environmental Interaction DCs
- **Simple Actions:** DC 10 (flip obvious switch, climb standard ladder)
- **Moderate Actions:** DC 13 (break reinforced door, disable simple mechanism)
- **Complex Actions:** DC 16 (solve puzzle under pressure, perform acrobatic maneuver)
- **Heroic Actions:** DC 19+ (dramatic environmental manipulation)

### Initiative and Environmental Changes
- **Static Elements:** Remain consistent throughout combat
- **Dynamic Elements:** Change on initiative count 20, 10, or when triggered
- **Triggered Elements:** Activate when specific conditions met (damage threshold, switch activation, time passage)
