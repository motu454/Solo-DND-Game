## Usage Notes

This file is intentionally left mostly empty to be filled in as the campaign progresses and specific house rules become necessary. Add modifications here when:

- Standard D&D 5e rules don't adequately support solo play mechanics
- Supernatural integration requires custom systems
- Political authority mechanics need specific clarification
- Intelligence operations require specialized rules
- Economic systems need campaign-specific modifications

When adding house rules:
1. **Document the reason** for the modification
2. **Reference specific situations** that prompted the rule
3. **Include examples** of how the rule applies in practice
4. **Cross-reference** with relevant campaign files
5. **Note any balance implications** for future sessions
