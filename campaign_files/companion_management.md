# Companion Management Framework

## Core Philosophy

### **Enhancement, Not Replacement**
- **Companions enhance player agency** rather than replacing decision-making
- **Tactical bonuses and information sources** instead of independent actors requiring separate management
- **Streamlined integration** avoiding complex turn-by-turn companion action resolution
- **Meaningful recharge mechanics** creating incentives for roleplay and relationship development

### **Attachment Bonus System**
**Treat companions as character enhancements rather than separate entities:**
- **Advantage on relevant rolls** + additional contextual benefits
- **Information and tactical advice** through character expertise and knowledge
- **Mechanical benefits refresh through meaningful interactions** rather than rest-based systems
- **No separate initiative or action economy management** - bonuses apply to player actions
