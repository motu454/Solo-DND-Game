# Skill Check System - Solo D&D Framework

## Core Principles

### **Always Require Checks For:**
- **Supernatural Detection:** Bob's enhanced abilities, Lyralei's insights, magical item effects
- **NPC Emotional Assessment:** Motivations, hidden agendas, trustworthiness beyond obvious cues
- **Social Information:** Reading between the lines, detecting deception, assessing loyalty
- **Environmental Analysis:** Hidden features, tactical advantages, threat assessment

### **Never Provide Automatic Information About:**
- Character motivations without appropriate skill checks
- Deception detection without rolling Insight
- Emotional states beyond surface behavioral cues
- Supernatural effects without magical verification

### **Exception: Obvious Information**
**Provide automatically without checks:**
- Information the character would obviously know from established relationships
- Environmental details that don't require special perception
- Previously established facts from campaign files
- Basic social cues requiring no special ability to detect

## DC Guidelines (Internal Reference Only)

### **Base DC Framework (Character Level 3)**
- **Trivial (DC 8):** No meaningful resistance, obvious information
- **Easy (DC 10):** Minimal resistance, basic challenges
- **Moderate (DC 13):** Standard resistance, typical difficulty
- **Hard (DC 16):** Significant resistance, challenging tasks
- **Very Hard (DC 19):** Strong opposition, complex situations
- **Nearly Impossible (DC 22+):** Extreme circumstances, maximum difficulty

### **Level Scaling Rule**
- **Current Level (3):** Use base DCs as listed above
- **Future Scaling:** +2 to all DCs per 4 character levels above 4th
- **Situational Modifiers:** Apply advantage/disadvantage and numerical bonuses based on circumstances

### **CRITICAL: Never Reveal DCs During Play**
- Show calculation transparently: "Roll [Skill] + modifier"
- Apply results based on success/failure without stating target numbers
- Maintain mystery about difficulty while providing clear mechanical resolution

## Information Quality Scaling

### **Failure (Miss DC)**
- **Surface Assessment:** Basic, obvious information only
- **Incorrect Impression:** Potentially misleading interpretation

### **Success (Meet/Beat DC)**
- **Accurate Basic Information:** Correct assessment of obvious elements
- **Clear Surface Emotions:** Genuine reactions and immediate motivations
- **Reliable Assessment:** Trustworthy evaluation within scope of question
- **Direct Answers:** Straightforward response to specific inquiries

### **High Success (Beat DC by 5+)**
- **Detailed Insights:** Deeper understanding of motivations and context
- **Hidden Information:** Elements not immediately obvious to casual observation
- **Emotional Nuance:** Complex feelings and internal conflicts
- **Strategic Intelligence:** Tactical or political implications of discoveries

### **Critical Success (Natural 20 or Beat DC by 10+)**
- **Complete Assessment:** Comprehensive understanding of situation
- **Hidden Agendas:** Long-term goals and concealed motivations
- **Relationship Dynamics:** Complex interpersonal connections and loyalties
- **Strategic Implications:** Full political, tactical, or supernatural consequences
